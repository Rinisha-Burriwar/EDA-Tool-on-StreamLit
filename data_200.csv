All families with students within the Level 1 proficiency status, will be a offered to be a part of this program.  These educational videos will be specially chosen by the English Learner Teacher and will be sent home regularly to watch.  The videos are to help the child develop early reading skills.\r\n\r\nParents that do not have access to a dvd player will have the opportunity to check out a dvd player to use for the year.

The students will experience how to be a helpful person by being part of team that teaches them to be positive, supportive, and encouraging to others. \r\nMy students will be using the soccer equipment during practice and games on a daily basis to learn and practice the necessary skills to develop a strong soccer team. This experience will create the opportunity for students to learn about being part of a team, and how to be a positive contribution for their teammates.

While sitting, the students will need to focus on balancing on the stool as they do their work. This will keep them from moving around and distracting others as they are engaged in various tasks. \r\n\r\nThe flexible seating option will benefit nearly every student in the class as they will want to join my math groups so that they can use the new seating option.

We are going to move our bodies at least 60 minutes daily. We will track our fitness levels using the scale each month. This grant will have allow us to have recess outside for 30 minutes and come inside for yoga.

Both parties can come up with new and ingenious ideas to help the student succeed on a higher level.  Each party can also see what works and what doesn't work.  Eventually, I as the teacher, could have a variety of modifications to use with new students. These modifications will help each student preform at an optimum level.

It is one of the best predictors of of a child's later reading success.  \r\n\r\nBefore a Pre-K child ever picks up a pencil, they are learning to write.  We start from day one working on fine motor development in many different ways.  We use pay-dough and play-dough cutting tools.  We string bead on  strings or pip cleaners.  We finger paint and tear paper.  We introduce letter formation with sand paper, curved and straight lines, play-dough, beans, and many more hands on resources to form the letters, numbers and shapes.  \r\n\r\nAs with any class, we have children that are able to do much more than others.  They have been exposed to many of these techniques and home or daycare.  We adjust plans to the needs of each individual child.

The items include a organized writing station that is child friendly. It also includes many tactile letter that teach formation, stamps, play-dough letter stamps, magnet boards to help with tracing, Lego sets that will form the letters, as well as, a paper dispenser that is child friendly and a roll of blank paper for them to use.
